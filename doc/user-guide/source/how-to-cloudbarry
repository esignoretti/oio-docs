This guide provides a few hints to help users getting started with the `AWS S3 command line client`_ using the OpenIO Swift gateway. By default, the gateway uses the `Swift3`_ middleware to allow the access to OpenIO object storage using Amazon S3 API.
The AWS CLI allows to use the different APIs provided by AWS, including the `S3`_ and `S3API`_ ones.

To use the AWS command, you need to set your credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file:

   .. code-block:: console

      # mkdir ~/.aws
      # echo "[default]
      aws_access_key_id=demo:demo
      aws_secret_access_key=DEMO_PASS" >~/.aws/credentials
